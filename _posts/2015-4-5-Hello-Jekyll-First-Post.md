My first blog post with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's pretty awesome blogging system.
Very lightweight, doesn't need separate hosting (uses GitHub hosting, for free), no DB , no CMS and no other heavyweight features. Just
write (with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) and post your thoughts.

To edit the content I use [prose.io/](http://prose.io/) and Jekyll template [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as a starting point for the blog structure.

So, thank to GitHub for this one. And Jekyll. And Hyde. And everyone.
