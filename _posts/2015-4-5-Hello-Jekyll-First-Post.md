My first post in the blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's pretty awesome blogging system.
Very lightweight, doesn't need separate hosting (uses GitHub hosting), no DB , no CMS and other heavyweight features. Just write (with Markdown), and post.

To edit the content I use [prose.io/](http://prose.io/) and Jekyll template [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as a starting point for the blog structure.

So, thank to GitHub for this one. And Jekyll. And Hyde. And everyone.
