My first post in the blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It's pretty awsome blogging system. Very lightweigh, doesn't need separate hosting (uses GitHub hosting), no DB , no CMS and other heavyweight features. Just write (with Markdown), and post.

I use [http://prose.io/](http://prose.io/) to edit the content and used [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as a starting point for the blog structure.

So, thank to GitHub for this one. And Jekyll. And Hyde. And everyone.
